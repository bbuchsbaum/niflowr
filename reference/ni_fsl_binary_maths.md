# FSL BinaryMaths

Use fslmaths to perform mathematical operations using a second image or

## Usage

``` r
ni_fsl_binary_maths(
  in_file,
  operand_file,
  operand_value,
  operation,
  args = NULL,
  internal_datatype = NULL,
  nan2zeros = NULL,
  out_file = NULL,
  output_datatype = NULL,
  .cwd = NULL,
  .env = NULL,
  .engine = NULL,
  .profile = NULL,
  dry_run = FALSE,
  echo = interactive()
)
```

## Arguments

- in_file:

  Character; file path. image to operate on **Required.**

- operand_file:

  Character; file path. second image to perform operation with
  **Required.**

- operand_value:

  Numeric. value to perform operation with **Required.**

- operation:

  Character; one of: "add", "sub", "mul", "div", "rem", "max", "min".
  operation to perform **Required.**

- args:

  Character. Additional parameters to the command

- internal_datatype:

  Character; one of: "float", "char", "int", "short", "double", "input".
  datatype to use for calculations (default is float)

- nan2zeros:

- out_file:

  Character; file path. image to write

- output_datatype:

  Character; one of: "float", "char", "int", "short", "double", "input".
  datatype to use for output (default uses input type)

- .cwd:

  Working directory override.

- .env:

  Named character vector of environment variables.

- .engine:

  Execution engine override.

- .profile:
